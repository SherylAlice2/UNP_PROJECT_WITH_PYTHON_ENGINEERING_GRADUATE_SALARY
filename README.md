Completed this project as a part of my Python (Machine Learning) Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

Key Highlights:

The project focuses on predicting engineering graduates' salaries using machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Gradient Boosting. It analyzes factors such as education background, psychological traits, and domain-specific skills to aid better salary structuring and informed decision-making, aligning graduatesâ€™ skills and education with company needs.
